This is an implementation of Deep Neural Decision Forests in PyTorch.
I have only added the database loader for MNIST Dataset.
Most of the code is from https://github.com/jingxil/Neural-Decision-Forests (Thanks!)
I have removed some part of the code that I didn't need.
Also, the changes required due the change in PyTorch API has been made. 
I have added Batch Normalisation Layers to analyse the change in performance.
